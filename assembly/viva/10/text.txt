The squares represent terminal nodes. These terminal nodes represent 
unsuccessful searches of the tree for key values. The searches did not end 
successfully, that is, because they represent key values that are not actually 
stored in the tree the round nodes represent internal nodes; these are the actual keys stored in 
the tree. Assuming that the relative frequency with which each key value is accessed 
is known, weights can be assigned to each node of the extended tree (p1 â€¦ 
p6). They represent the relative frequencies of searches terminating at each 
node, that is, they mark the successful searches.
