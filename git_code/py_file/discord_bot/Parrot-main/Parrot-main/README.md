## Security?
Bot is well tested especially moderation commands. So, don't worry about the permissions. Member with proper permission can run the moderation commands or other server setup.

## Feature Explanation

### Global Chat

It's a channel which connects one channel with other servers. As it connects a lot of servers, members might use cuss words or advertise. Parrot is aware of it and auto-moderation will automatically setup in that channel.

They aren't really bots, fact is, Parrot sending message in all server would be pain for her. So, she use Discord web-hook bots.

### Telephone

As #global-chat connects server wide. Telephone is similar but it connects only one server with duration of 120 seconds. It's just like normal phone call, thing is, it's in text. Parrot is aware of spam as well. So when using Telephone auto-moderation will automatically enforced.

Tags are used to store information that can be used later on. Timers are useful, it reminds you when to do your task or just a normal reminder. TODO too a useful module which can be used to list all the task you want to do. 

In future these modules will be upgraded.
